 <p>I have defined a function (SQL-like parser) for phone book records in Problem 1 to implement the 
operations and to  print SQL like output. </p>

<p>2.1<br>
  SELECT * FROM phone_records; This statement reads the first 10 records and displays them
on the console.</p>
<p>2.2<br>
  SELECT * FROM phone_records WHERE name=’doe’; this statement filters the records and
displays the record(s) where ‘Doe’ is found.</p>
<p>2.3<br>
   INSERT INTO phone_records(name, email,phone 1, phone 2)
VALUES(‘Test’,’test@test.xtyz’,’1234456’,’1233233’)
This statement should create a new entry in the dataset and the same </p>
<p>2.4<br>
